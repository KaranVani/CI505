# CI505

Lab exercises and summative tests for the CI505 module at the
University of Brighton. Most of them will take longer than a single
lab session to complete so use them for independent study. Also, once
the assignment is available you may prefer to carry on working on that
-- later exercises are provided for people who want some extra
practice with Haskell. 

## Week 1

[Getting started](labs/Week1.md).

## Week 2

[More practice with lists](labs/Week2.md).

## Week 3

Read the tutorial on [Cabal](labs/CABAL.md), the haskell build tool.

## Week 4

[In-class test](in-class-tests/test1/README.md). Now is the
time for you to get an idea of your progress. Complete the exercises
and submit on studentcentral **before the end of week 5** in order to
receive feedback onilne, or approach your tutor in a lab session for
feedback in person.

## Week 5

**Start work on the assignment**. From now on you can carry on working
on this and/or have a go at subsequent exercises.

## Week 6

[Spamfilter program](labs/Spam.md)

## Week 7

[Working with typeclasses](labs/Typeclasses.md).

## Week 8

TODO

## Week 9

[Parsing and IO exercises](labs/Parsing/README.md).

## Week 10 

[Webservices with Haskell](https://github.com/jimburton/haskell-webservice/blob/master/README.md). 
Note that this time-consuming exercise lives in its own repository. Although you may not have
time to complete it, you can always use it as a basic reference on the Happstack web framework.

## Week 11

Complete earlier exercises or get help with the assignment.
