## Exercises

1. Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists. If a
   list contains repeated elements they should be placed in separate
   sublists. We want the function to work for any data type that can
   be compared for equality, i.e. is a member of the `Eq` type
   class. So your function should have this type signature:
	
   ```
   pack :: Eq a => [a] -> [[a]]
   ```

   Note that the type of the result is a list of lists. Example:

   ```haskell
   λ> pack ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'a', 
             'a', 'd', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e']
   ["aaaa","b","cc","aa","d","eeee"]
   λ> pack [1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2]
   [[1], [2, 2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2, 2]]
   ["aaaa","b","cc","aa","d","eeee"]
   ``` 

   **Hint** One way to achieve this is by using the functions 
[takeWhile](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:takeWhile) 
and [dropWhile](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:dropWhile).
Try experimenting with `dropWhile` and `takeWhile` in the REPL:

   ```
   λ> :t takeWhile
   takeWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
   λ> takeWhile (\x -> x=='a') "aaabcd"
   "aaa"
   λ> :t dropWhile
   dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
   λ> dropWhile (\x -> x=='a') "aaabcd"
   "bcd"
   ```
	
	
2. Create the *run-length encoding* of a list, `encode :: Eq a => [a]
   -> [(Int, a)]`. Use your `pack` function to implement the so-called
   *run-length encoding* data compression method. Consecutive
   duplicates of elements are encoded as pairs `(n, c)`, where `n` is
   the number of duplicates of the element `c`.

   Example:

   ```haskell
   λ> encode "aaaabccaadeeee"
   [(4,'a'),(1,'b'),(2,'c'),(2,'a'),(1,'d'),(4,'e')]
   ```

   **Hint:** `map` a lambda function over the list of lists that you get
back from `pack`. This function will take a list as input and return a
pair of its length and its first element.

3. Given a run-length code list generated as in the previous problem,
   construct its uncompressed version with a function called `decode
   :: Eq a => [(Int, a)] -> [a]`.

   Example:
   ```haskell
   λ> decode [(4,'a'),(1,'b'),(2,'c'),(2,'a'),(1,'d'),(4,'e')]
   "aaaabccaadeeee"
   ```

   **Hint:** Again, a good way to start is to `map` a lambda expression over the
input. This function will take a pair, `(i,c)`. Use the functions
`repeat` and `take` to create a list of `c` values with length
`i`. This will result in a list of lists which you can flatten with
the `concat` function. 

   So `decode` could have this kind of structure:

   ```haskell
   decode xs = concat (map (...) xs)
   ```

   Using `map` then `concat` is very common -- **there is a function that
does them both for you**:
[`concatMap`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:concatMap). Use
that instead of the structure suggested above.

4. Create a data type, `RLE a` (for "run-length encodings" of values
   of type `a`). Use the `deriving` keyword to make it a member of the
   `Show` typeclass. It needs two constructors: `Single a`, to
   represent a single occurence of a character in a list, and
   `Multiple Int a` to represent several consecutive occurrences of a
   value. 
   
   Create a modified version of the `encode` function that produces a
   list of `RLE a` values instead of pairs -- `encodeRLE :: Eq a =>
   [a] -> [RLE a]`.

	Example:

   ```haskell
   λ> encodeRLE "aaaabccaadeeee"
   [Multiple 4 'a',Single 'b',Multiple 2 'c',
   Multiple 2 'a',Single 'd',Multiple 4 'e']
   ```

   **Hint:** First, process the input with `encode`, then `map` over the
result. The lambda that you map will take a pair, `(i,c)`, and use one
of the `RLE` constructors if `i==1`, and a different one otherwise.

5. Given a run-length code list generated as in the previous problem,
   construct its uncompressed version -- `decodeRLE :: Eq a => [RLE a]
   -> [a]`.

   Example:
   ```haskell
   λ> decodeRLE [Multiple 4 'a',Single 'b',Multiple 2 'c',
        Multiple 2 'a',Single 'd',Multiple 4 'e']
   "aaaabccaadeeee"
   ```

   **Hint:** Again, you can use `concatMap`. This time the lambda that
you map over the input will take an `RLE a` value. Use the `case`
structure in the lambda to pattern match on the different values of
`RLE`:

   ```
   decodeRLE xs = concatMap (\rle -> case rle of
        (Single x)     -> ...
        (Multiple i x) -> ...) xs 
   ```
